    <h2>Gorakhpur Terracotta</h2>
    <p class="about">The highly acclaimed terracotta of Gorakhpur made from the special soil found in Bhathat area of Uttar Pradesh stands testimony to thousands of years of traditional art. The richness of this art seen in the different designs and types of bells, vases, Ganeshas, Buddhas, tables, elephants with mahouts, deer, horses, bullock carts, horse carts, lamps and chandeliers have received numerous laurels over the years.</p>
    <br>
     <p class="about">The clay used in these terracotta products is the cabis (kabis) mitti found in the ponds of Aurangabad, Bhairawa and Budadeeh villages only during the months of May and June as they get filled up with water over the rest of the year. This soil contains the right amount of softness and elasticity that helps the artisans create very delicate and small objects.

     </p>
     <br>
     <p class="about">Fine nets are used to remove stones and other impurities from the clay. Water is added to the clay and the craftsmen often stamp and crush the clay for better cohesion. The mixed clay is placed on the centre of the potterâ€™s wheel which is rotated with the help of a stick. As the wheel starts rotating, the craftsmen begin to shape the clay into the required form.</p></div>
